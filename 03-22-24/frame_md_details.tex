\begin{frame}[fragile]{MD Simulation General Details}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item All-atom models with all glycan stems retained
        \item All systems built using \href{https://pestifer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/}{pestifer}
        \item Solvated in explicit water (TIP3P)
        \item System sizes 320,000 to 340,000 atoms
        \item NAMD v 2.14 using CHARMM-FF v36
        \item Production MD: NPT (310 K, 1 bar) for 200 ns (100,000,000 time-steps)
        \item Observables:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item opening angles measured via protomer alignment (on gp120 and gp41 separately)
            \item HR1N alpha helicity (not shown in this talk)
            \item $\alpha_9$ tilt angles (not shown in this talk)
            \item snapshots
        \end{itemize}
