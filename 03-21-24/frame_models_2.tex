    %     \item ``\textcolor{DUblue}{C6-FT-HHL}'': as-received structure; HR1N unfolded in protomer 3; MPER present in protomer 1 only

            \begin{itemize}
                \item SOSIPs used are 4zmj (state 2) and 5vn3
                \item all ligands removed, engineered mutations reverted to WT 
                \item gp41's grown out to 687 and then ligated onto MPER-TM 6e8w
                \item Relaxed via MD with TM's held in place
                \item Currently investigating membrane embeddings (z-position of midplane)
            \end{itemize}
