1. Resolving MPER and TM are important for understanding stabilizing factors for state-1 Env
2. Latest structures of Tri-FPPR mutants from Sodroski lab resolve MPER alpha-heli[x,es] for at least one protomer
3. Tri-FPPR structures also correlate alpha-helical HR1N segments with larger interprotomer opening angles
   - protomer 1 and 2 have folded HR1N and larger opening angles
   - protomer 3 has an unfoled HR1N and a smaller opening angles
   - protomer 1 includes MPER residues out to 687
4. Using the "class-6" Tri-FPPR structure, we asked the following questions:
   a. how does it behave as a starting structure for unrestrained, water-solvated MD?  How stable are opening angles and MPER structure?
   b. If we systematically convert unfolded HR1Ns to alpha-helical states, how does this alter the models' behavior under MD?
   c. If we systematically build in missing MPER helices, how does this alter the  models' behavior under MD?
5. We built and simulated the following all-atom models:
   - C6_FT_HHL: the as-received structure ("Class 6, full trimer, HR1N's are helical (protomer 1, 2) and loops (protomer 3))
   etc

6. Results show variations in opening angles and lots of MPER flexibility

7. We have also built models of Env with MPER-TM using SOSIP ectodomains (4zmj and 5vn3) with NMR-structures of MPER-TM trimers (6e8w) and are beginning membrane-bound simulations
